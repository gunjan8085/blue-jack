I'll help you create API payloads for testing the business routes in Postman. Based on the code, there are two endpoints available for business operations. I'll provide the complete details for each endpoint.

1. **Register New Business**
- **Method**: POST
- **URL**: `{{base_url}}/api/v1/business/signup`
- **Headers**:
  ```
  Content-Type: application/json
  ```
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "owner": "65f1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1",  // MongoDB ObjectId of the employee
    "brandName": "Sample Business",
    "website": "https://samplebusiness.com",
    "thumbnail": "https://example.com/thumbnail.jpg",
    "about": "This is a sample business description",
    "serviceCategories": ["65f1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j2"],  // Array of ServiceCategory ObjectIds
    "teamSize": {
      "min": 5,
      "max": 50
    },
    "address": {
      "addressLine1": "123 Business Street",
      "addressLine2": "Suite 100",
      "city": "New York",
      "state": "NY",
      "country": "USA",
      "pincode": "10001"
    },
    "isOnlineOnly": false,
    "existingSoftware": "Custom Solution",
    "foundUsAt": "Google Search",
    "media": [
      {
        "url": "https://example.com/photo1.jpg",
        "type": "photo"
      }
    ],
    "timings": [
      {
        "days": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],  // Monday to Friday
        "time": [
          {
            "open": {
              "hour": 9,
              "minute": 0
            },
            "close": {
              "hour": 17,
              "minute": 0
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

2. **Get All Businesses**
- **Method**: GET
- **URL**: `{{base_url}}/api/v1/business/getAllBusiness`
- **Headers**: None required
- **Request Body**: None required

**Expected Responses**:

1. For Register New Business:
- Success Response (201):
  ```json
  {
    "data": {
      // Business object with all fields
    },
    "success": true
  }
  ```
- Error Response (500):
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "message": "Error message here"
  }
  ```

2. For Get All Businesses:
- Success Response (200):
  ```json
  {
    "data": [
      // Array of business objects
    ],
    "success": true,
    "message": "Businesses retrieved successfully"
  }
  ```
- Error Response (500):
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "message": "Internal Server Error"
  }
  ```

**Postman Setup Tips**:
1. Create a new collection called "Business API"
2. Set up an environment variable `base_url` with your API base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`)
3. Create two requests in the collection for the above endpoints
4. For the register endpoint, you can save the request body as a template in Postman
5. You can use the "Tests" tab in Postman to add basic response validation

Would you like me to provide any additional details or clarification about any of these endpoints?
